                <p class="insidep">What one might call "times" or "epochs," they come and go, like ocean waves.
                When one says "there was a time or once such thing happened" more often than not, 
                one likes to forget of the many waves that have crept over our sandy shores
                unexpectedly and as softly as an infant crawling. And so, in the spirit of the
                particular wave that once in a while insidiously crawls upon us, one writes
                of a time when life happened without consequence, or so one thought, but quite 
                expectantly left a mark of wet dirt and forever an imprint on one&rsquo;s time. Although 
                the following works belong to a brown-eyed girl in the prime of her torrent,
                her footprints might echo onto others&rsquo; seashores to leave tiny webbed feet of green-moss hue planted securely on the ground.

                <p class= "insidep">"For some time, I have wondered how misfortune approaches me teasingly.<br> 
                I can just imagine a prankster god simply relaxing under a native sun<br>
                thinking of ways to LOL with my stubborn attempt at survival.<br>
                I will probably comply too with a barrage of mishaps and all." Janis Jimenez</p><br><br>
                <p class="insidep">Poetics, according to Aristotle, is of greater importance than history because poetry is creation. He adds that "poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are singulars." Aristotle explains that by universal he means something that "such or such kind of man will probably or necessarily say or do." Poetry has no limitations, no concept of time, and it plays on the possibility of what might happen. History can only focus on what already has passed. One might say then that poetry gives its keeper a world of infinite possibilities, and that is which sets it nearer to philosophy. This is not to say that history cannot be written in a beautiful manner, and in fact the poet derives inspiration from all that has preceded, from current events, and from the unbounded possibilities of the future.
