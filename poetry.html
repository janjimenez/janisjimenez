            even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth with<br> broken wings."</h3>

                 Silence thy bird of prey might-less god<br> 
                 for my love is passing by.<br>
                 Her name is Not-I, and she wears a cloak of night.<br>
                 Reverend Lady, Mistress of the Night, White Child,<br> 
                 May only the True follow you and kiss your brow.
                 <br><br>
                 Become the word that empowers you,<br> 
                 Crave deprave. Surrender. Us under. Ground surround. Sorrow by morrow.<br> 
                 Death, my end, Not-I, my Goddess.<br>
                 Be sinful, be immoral, be wicked,<br> 
                 Be strong and proud, be the huntress, be a wo-without the-man, be self.<br> 
                 Even if you hear:<br>
                 "Death be not proud."<br>

                    Tree branches block the light<br>
                    And govern truth.<br>
                    I cannot bring myself to write your names of stone<br>
                    With a hand that wriggles on this page.<br>
                    Sweet seedlings, I have heard<br>
                    Mexican fields bare strange flowers<br>
                    Blood on the petals<br>
                    And blood at the roots.<br>
                    Brown shoots shrivel in the Southern heat.<br>
                    Strange flowers, indeed, growing out of planted weeds.<br>
                    Northern breeze,<br>
                    Complicity does tax.<br>
                    Forced migrations<br>
                    Of military means,<br>
                    Tanks, guns, bullets and death.<br>
                    Spring seedlings<br>
                    I refuse to write your names<br>
                    In the language of the plow<br>
                    Or the flowerpots.

                Rising peak in sight<br> 
                A last step before the summit.<br> 
                But it slithers second to second masking time interminably.<br> 
                The touch,<br> 
                Humanity&rsquo;s touch: impersonal, outwardly tangible.<br> 
                It will come, I know it.<br> 
                And yet it creeps upon me like the acrid taste of the decomposed.<br> 
                Reluctant hand shake,<br> 
                Swift pat on the shoulder,<br> 
                Fleeing embrace.<br> 
                I will suffer the foul smell from the purity of intent,<br> 
                The unbearable nonsense of external stimuli,<br> 
                The awakening of the self,<br> 
                the awareness of the same,<br> 
                The putrid contentment of being alive.<br> 
                For you, this, my fealty.<br> 
                For you, this, my truth.<br> 
                For you, this, my words.<br>

               Dear friend,<br> 
               -That&rsquo;s enough, I have a friend-<br> 
               Thank you for being so kind<br> 
               Like when you ate all the cheese cake<br> 
               And left me none.<br> 
               TY for taking in that extra pound<br> 
               Straight to your thighs instead of mine.<br> 
               Thank you my friend, smarter of the two,<br> 
               For being so thoughtful like<br> 
               When you let me in first<br> 
               To bear the full brunt of whatever is awful.<br> 
               Dear friend you are sweet and strong.<br> 
               Remember that time I helped a nurse restrain you,<br> 
               Since you were so drunk, She had to sedate you.<br> 
               Thank you my friend for being so honest<br> 
               Like when you said my ego is too big to fit in my anus.<br> 
               Or remember that time when you were angry<br> 
               And said I wasn&rsquot a being,<br> 
               But rather this weird Dr. Seuss thing.<br> 
               Dear friend,<br> 
               With eyes so green they remind me ofâ€¦ vermin,<br> 
               With your long locks of cheese doodle hair,<br> 
               (Smell of which, are your feet when bare).<br> 
               So short, the size of three lemon squares,<br> 
               With a sourly face trying to rip me apart<br> 
               After reading this flair.<br> 
               Thank you for being there.<br> 
               PS. I forgot to flush.<br>

          <h1 class="innertitle">It Was in a Dream</h1>
                <p class="insidep">
               It was in a dream.<br> 
               In the attic of my inner self,<br> 
               The imagination of childhoods passed lies deep within the unconscious state,<br> 
               Swept away by hurting memories<br> 
               A surreal image of your eyes,<br> 
               Deep set, a hue of cavernous black,<br> 
               Uncovered and unveiled.<br>
               Your voice trespassed the dreaming realm and resonated<br> 
               And as it spoke<br> 
               I trembled and I wept, wept the tears not shed upon your altars.<br>
               You are my human heart who carries with my fusilladed sins,<br> 
               Which has rendered me dogmatic.<br>
               I have become introvert.<br> 
               I have been in a place, within a wakeful state,<br> 
               A place where life loses its meaning and revolves in nothingness,<br> 
               Where feeling becomes strange and pain second nature,<br> 
               Where Life is a prison and Time the punisher, where there is no you.<br>
               And it was in a dream where I found you again,<br> 
               And It was in a dream where I kept every part of you in reference to me.
