            <p class= "text">Depression used to knock on my door, stay for a while, and then leave willingly. But, its visits last longer now. Palpitating, it stays unmolested digging a hole through my lungs, until the creature slithers away lest it suffocate me. I breathe again. Yet, once more I wait for the insistent loud thump, thump, thump, at the door, and the low hisses in my ear. <br><br>
I have avoided using the term depression in front of others. Though in solitude, I often wonder how rage turned into sadness, that moment when life sawed my spirit in two without any splinters. Unquestionably, my soul squirmed like the little slugs in salt showers of my youth, yet it did not bleed... <br><br>
The memories of an eight-year-old persist. I lie on a queen size bed and can&rsquo;t tell whether the day has begun already or if it has decided to hide. Paralyzed from the shoulders down, I can only close my eyes and move my head slightly. The hand, wrinkled, dark under the sun, and very thin, appears over a pair of protruding tiny specks, a poor excuse for woman&rsquo;s breasts. White terror begins to climb from my toes across my body slowly drawing on my skin, in permanent ink, impotence. Swaying, an autumn leaf falling, fatigue settles on me offering respite. I can move somewhat.<br><br>
Looking up, the familiar face smiles. I want to scream, push back the caressing hand, and distort the face. I want to run, but to my right a wall stands overlooking and to my left a brown mountain blocks my way. So I shake and lie quietly and wait for the session to end. Trapped, my feet huddle just behind the intruder&rsquo;s knees. The hand keeps moving, and I go blank. Time creeps along possibly years pass before the figure decides to leave. Finally alone, I allow rivers to overflow…<br><br>
Unable to move beyond that first split, I kept appearances, hiding tears and hurt from those around me. Resembling supermarket clean-cut bone, mass produced and readily accessible, the pieces of my "self" have lain comfortably on the ground, beaten, all these years.<br><br>
Terror gripped me and molded me like play-dough. The precocious child who spoke clearly at eight months old and conversed with anyone, my other self, dissipated within the logical but unresponsive person I am today. Anger surfaced becoming hurt, pain, tears, and even depression somewhere in my teen years. Unsocial, as a survival mechanism, I grew numb, and the numbness opened a void allowing emotions to blend giving birth to indistinguishable holes of empty space. Nothing could go in them; nothing could come out. Happiness or sadness, life or death, meant nothing and no need or want.<br><br>
Another "self" surfaced; I masqueraded in my family&rsquo;s eyes as a strong resilient person. This person could do anything. She had many friends, went to parties, worked hard, drank liquor, and even managed to laugh hard and loud, albeit with traces of cruelty. This person faked happiness or perhaps truly felt it at some point. Great things were expected from her as well. This person owned the world until nightfall. <br><br>
But a rupture turned waterfall poured sensations and filled my empty cup. At my house, at work, or while walking in blank corridors, the stabbing pain&rsquo;s torrents usually grew threateningly. Few instances while in class unbearable pain rushed to hide me in one of the schools&rsquo; bathroom stalls. Wheezing and out of breath, I remember closing the tiny door behind me. As all stood motionless and the audible ringing threatened to drown me, the numbing pressure in my chest muffled cries. I bit into pieces of cloth and flesh and let small quiet noises out. After realizing the obscure yelling did not fulfill the urge to cry, I granted my hands permission to fall hard again and gain on my thighs and sometimes on my head or on my face. Hot liquid rained until calm took over. <br><br>
At such times no one sees me cry; no one among the multitude needs to see me begging for release. I own the sharp pangs and the tears. I own the sadness and desperation that assails my psyche. No one but myself can save me. Books taught me as much during some of my most tormented teen years. Introduced to the joys of reading, I immersed my attention for long periods to evade depression. <br><br>
From the love for reading, emerged love for writing.  I discovered that not only could I read stories, but I could also write them and flood them with pain, anger, my soul, and even hope. Writings from the heart document suffering, making us stronger, and making life bearable. Pen and paper anchor me to safety. I have felt the pain both emotional and physical, and I have found a new outlet. If I still exist, I can still write. </div>

                "You can&rsquo;t make the incomprehensible comprehensible without losing it completely, and I notice now the way I involuntarily keep trying, as I set down this declaration to sort things out and give everything a &rsquo;meaning. &rsquo; Yet I have nothing to give." Max Frisch from <i>I&rsquo;m Not Stiller</i><br><br><br>I find comfort in watching things die. Have you ever placed a household roach- one of those scurrying critters that can be found all around the city especially in your local restaurants- inside a half-empty half-full glass beaker and watched its frantic attempts at freedom? By chance, one such fell on my of Red Apple ale once. I had to sit there and watch its every effort. I wanted to reach and stick my finger, help the bug out. I can see its tiny prosthetic wings&rsquo; futile flapping. I thought its pride might be hurt so I hid my pity, and I let it fight the current secretly cheering it on. It drowned. Phew. I can&rsquo;t watch it. Is the struggle moments before you-know-what that terrifies me. Oh yeah, but death, yeah, death is beautiful." <br><br><br>
(I wonder: is the end oblivion or something more? Roly-polies must be good too.) <br><br><br>
"Your basic law of physics states that in order for the physical mass of an object to exist, there must be a bigger object possessing a greater size in which the first object can reside within it; furthermore, there must be a third entity whose physical mass allows it for the first and second materials&rsquo; existence in its enclosure. Think of Russian dolls where one in cases the other and another does the same. This goes on indefinitely in a never-ending caracol shell, an infinite spiral of neatly stacked multidimensional babushkas floating in what we call space." 
<br><br><br>
"But humans, they want to classify everything. All must have order and a proper name. Because they have a linear mind, you see, their classifications are usually erroneous. Moreover, one day chickens become dinosaurs and, boom, the big bang theory disposed, out the window, and buried. In the end- misclassification Dr. Rata misclassifications- I refuse the pill. Oh no, you don&rsquo;t have to. Free samples? A whole bottle and a gift card you say? If that&rsquo;s the case, write me up. One shall do."
<br><br><br>
Today my therapist, lovely Ms. Alice Bratta, brought me this notebook full of white pages that I&rsquo;m supposed to fill with my thoughts. It is an exercise, so she says, that will strengthen our bond and create a bridge between us. I write she reads. So as they say, here goes nothing. <br><br><br>
My name is Pepita Jimenez, well no; my full name is Mariajulia Pepita Jimenez Valleverde, and I have suffered from what I call the I-Don&rsquo;t-Know syndrome for the first 25 years of my life. <br><br><br>
"How are you doing today Ms. Jimenez?" <br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"How was your weekend?" <br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"Had any fun?" <br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"Feeling happy?" <br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"Feeling sad?" <br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"Are you lesbian?" <br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"How are your classes going?"<br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"Do you feel pain?" <br>
I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
"Are you depressed, Ms. Jimenez?" <br>
I am not!<br>
<br><br><br>
Mexicans have a fascination with death. From the old Aztec ancestral rituals to the pyramids in whose stairs beating hearts rolled down steep steps in veneration to the Sun God Huitzilopochtli. But death was not death to the Aztecs. Death was transcendence mostly a metamorphosis. It was an honor to meet such an end, and like warriors that died in battle to be reborn as butterflies, death under sacrifice did not go unrewarded. <br><br><br>
Mexico, ombligo de luna, is the moon&rsquo;s belly button. Because of the absence of the old gods, Mexicans have created a new cult that helps them cope. It is the veneration of La Ni&#241;a Blanca, the White Maiden, also known as La Santa Muerte. She is a jealous creature and can&rsquo;t be placed in the home with other religious figures. Her flower is the vivid orange cempazuchilt that grows in October. It has a sweet smell of defeat and surrender. If you burn a candle to her, you must burn one always for she is greedy. La Santa Muerte can&rsquo;t be bought; she must be given to you as a protective charm. And be careful when asking anything from her, she works only for commission and according to the difficulty of the job her payment must meet that mark. She likes Tabaco, tequila, money, candles, incense, her flowers, prayers, commitment, and your soul.  <br><br><br>

I must write about personal things my hypnotherapist, Ms. Bratta, said to me the last visit. I think there&rsquo;s nothing more intimate than one&rsquo;s family: <br>
I sit at the far left corner of my bed right next to the huge window when my brother walks in. He doesn&rsquo;t knock. I have been contemplating whether to open the shutters; the dark damp atmosphere of the room makes me hesitate. It is quietly somber, welcoming, and very untidy. <br><br><br>
"What the fuck are you doing?" <br>
"Looking out the window." <br>
"Don&rsquo;t be smart. I didn&rsquo;t spend all my youth working 12-hour shifts so you could spend your life sitting on your ass." <br>
(I think: Nobody knows the trouble I&rsquo;ve seen… apparently, not even myself.) <br>
"Look at me when I&rsquo;m talking to you. How much money you owe his month? Huh?" There is an interval of silence. <br>
"Why do I have to deal with your shit on top of my own problems? I got enough at work. Can&rsquo;t you at least take care of yourself?" <br>
He is talking too fast, and all I can do is stare and occasionally pick at my scabs. <br>
"I got Kay and her man coming at me asking me for the money. Fuck! Why can&rsquo;t you act normal?" <br>
"But," <br>
"Don&rsquo;t interrupt me when I&rsquo;m talking to you. Everything you say is garbage. Fucking garbage. I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m tired of you, of your childishness, of this house, of this goddamned run-down family that&rsquo;s going nowhere." <br>
A pause. <br>
"Sometimes I just want to run away from all of you." <br>
I want to tell him that if he just gives me a little bit more time this time for sure will be the last. He stands above me crossing his arms over his beer belly for a few moments then letting them down in exasperation. I won&rsquo;t fail again. I won&rsquo;t break this time around. I promise soundlessly over and over again, a spiral. <br>
"At least tell me you have a good reason for getting fired." <br>
"I wasn&rsquo;t fired. I left." He might hit me; I think. <br>
"What for?" <br>
"It became boring." I wince. <br>
"Basura," he continues murmuring as he leaves drearily. <br>
I remain at a 90 degrees angle and watch his back move away from sight. Unable to support myself, I slowly leak like a leftover raindrop. I want to cry. But, I rise carefully only to fall again counterclockwise. <br>
He says all I utter is garbage. He might be right. If this is true, it means that the trash- not to be confused with thrash metal- is coming from me. My inside must be a dumping ground for dead bodies, for all dead things, dead objects, as well as dead atoms, and most definitely dead organic plant matter. <br><br><br> 
Ms. Bratta, my witch doctor, wants me to tell her about the OTHER doctor from the clinic. I don&rsquo;t know. She thinks I should not be taking pills because her magic is strong. It is strong enough for any sickness even if it&rsquo;s the taciturn illness of a first world country spoiled college student. She is, after all, a descendant from of an old Yoruban tribe that has practiced the arts for generations. As Google translate may add, ọpọlọpọ awọn ibukun, many blessings. 
<br><br><br>
I explain: it is not that I was not made to understand the Policy of Entailment or maybe it was because I knew it too well that I let it happen so often. In fact, it was probably the third, fourth, or sixtieth time it happened. I am just bad at playing sick, and taking pills requires such a focused mind so often I go hours without one. Even so after each cursed episode, I am left with a feeling of happy contentment much better than the actual effects of the pill. It&rsquo;s as if after a great suffering my will to live rekindles. It is no cheap ecstasy either; it is a collected peace and stillness, and I have become addicted to it. Before I knew it, I was intentionally delaying the pill intake just to go through the delicious pain again.
<br><br><br>
It is widely known that 95% of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy. But, the human eye is blinded by light; it cannot see anything other than substantialized particles. We are hopeless in darkness, yet we are surrounded by it. Our lives are feverish aspirations to reach the light somehow. Society helps by whispering to stay on that track and grasp a bright future; become a superman. But, I have found that alone in a dark room suddenly life makes sense. <br><br><br>
I maintain, then, that not everyone knows the first precept of the great Law of Alchemy, in which it states that 'in order to gain, something of equal value must be lost.' This is the Law of Equivalent Exchange. <br>
(I wonder: what do I have to give in return to have the rainbow pills block all emotion?)
<br><br><br>
I have an appointment with Alice-we are on first-name basis now- the Haitian Santera to have her pray to Yemayah on my behalf. I think it&rsquo;s helping. Every Thursday at exactly 3:05 pm I walk into her office with the marble composition notebook in hand. Today she wants to know about the effects of the pills. I wrote the following: <br><br><br>
I felt my heart bulging quietly, becoming impossible to bear upon my breast, a tumorous mass of tissue-muscle and regrets. It bubbled into existence tracing slowly my life before the pills. It grew bigger and demanding some space from those purple-green veiny twins. 
<br><br><br>
Realizing I had run out of time and the fall coming immediately without a single warning, I knew I was in trouble. These horrible feelings gripped themselves tightly around my waist. I gripped my gut fiercely trying to delay the process of diffusion. The drugs moved from a region of lower concentration in my body through sweat to a region of higher concentration in the world. I fanned myself to keep them in. Too late. I had taken the siesta precisely at the wrong moment and now the pills had decidedly been processed and their antidote discarded. <br><br><br>
I needed to get to the bathroom cabinet as soon as possible without delay no matter what obstacle. Grabbing my gut, I focused my energy on containment and with great anxiety a rolled to the side of the bed and slowly placed my feet on the rough carpet. It was impossible. I tried standing up completely, but in midterm, I lay down again letting the feeling of vertigo pass. I wriggled my way to the edge of the bed trying to calm the nausea that had overtaken my mind. The dizziness was getting worse moving slowly downwards falling through my bed, through the floor, though the basement, through concrete, through the earth&rsquo;s core, through its axis of rotation, and back. <br><br><br>
The tumor grew marble-sized in the mouth of my stomach. It swelled in alarming rates. Tiny microscopic holes began to appear on my chicken skin moving about at much ease searching for the summit. I grabbed my stomach firmly. I would have to reach my destination on all fours. Trying not to think about the sushi roll taking shape, I took a deep drag of air and allowed my full body to slide off the bed. I almost crawled. Instead, I curved my back and placed my palms flat on the wooden floor unwilling to bend my knees. I began to walk perfectly archways like an autumn rainbow to my personal drug store, the medicine cabinet. <br><br><br>
A fine sight, a grazing cow on a mission I was. Panic arrested my limbs and I began to shake feeling my gut taking part in a liposuction beginning to tare away form me. It fell on the ground in tiny chunks of blue goo. I swear huge lumps fell when I wouldn&rsquo;t stop moving. Terrified, I progressed faster with greater urgency. The mass was the size of a tennis ball at reaching the sink. I couldn&rsquo;t stand so I clawed at the sink to reach the solitary gold bottle with the rainbow pills inside. I closed my eye to avoid the reflection on the mirror. Grabbing the bottle, I threw myself on the ground curling fetus position. I took out the colorful pill of the largest sequence blue-purple-green-yellow-red-pink-beige and placed one in my hand. For a second, I watched the sequence change before placing it in my mouth and letting it numb me at last. I felt reasoning sinking right before release.
<br><br><br>
I don&rsquo;t think that Ms. Alice Bratta, my Peruvian shaman, knows how to classify what is wrong with me, and Dr. Rata only gives me pills. Alice said that I should focus on writing my made-up stories and I might be able to make a few bucks some day. I wrote: <br>
Aristotle warns against plots that have "neither probability nor necessity" because it creates an uninteresting episodic plot of which it cannot be derived much reaction from. Not all tragedies are good ones. They must have according to Aristotle six aspects to them: Spectacle, Character, Fable, Diction, Melody, and Thought. It is also important to note that I have none: <br><br><br>
She checked her stomach and saw no visible signs of blood. It had a smooth surface and felt full. She went back to clean the blood just in case, but instead of finding a part of her entrails on the ground, Pepita Jimenez found a rolled-up slug of lard resembling a giant black bean. It had no eyes, not even the sockets, but had an opening that acted as a mouth and flashed a full set of white teeth. She marveled at its tamale-like extremities. They seemed to function as legs and arms, but they were of no use to him- yes, him, for he was of a male disposition- lying on his back for as much as it tried to move them they would not straighten him. <br><br><br>
"Frijolito," Pepita Jimenez called out, and the thing smiled wryly in response. <br>
She picked the worm up and it glided through her body until it found a comfortable place on her shoulder. It pointed its tiny hand at the door clearly motioning her forward. Pepita wondered what kind of creature Frijolito was, and she settled for her soul. That must be it because he came from her stomach and everyone knows that the soul is located in the appendix. <br><br><br>
When she took it to the clinic for a refill, all were very accepting in the waiting area. The patients commented on its marvelous good manners, and its high intelligence, and the receptionist on its pompom chicks. It was not until she asked the nurse about Frijolito that Pepita realized not everybody could see him. Or maybe the nurse pretended not to see him. <br>
"What is it?" <br>
"What do you mean Ms. Jimenez? What is what?" <br>
"Him on my shoulder?" <br>
"Why, I don&rsquo;t see anything." <br>
"Here!" <br>
"Oh, that. It&rsquo;s just a mole dear. Dr. Rata will see you now." 
<br><br><br>
The urge to cry creeps insidiously. It comes, just like that, as it pleases without at the very least considering the place and time. I feel that I’m in one of those sitcoms on Spanish T.V. where the main character only cries from one eye, and it&rsquo;s always just one massive tear that rolls over her MAC-powdered cheek. Sometimes I wonder if I&rsquo;m really sad or if it&rsquo;s just convenient so I do it on purpose to gain someone&rsquo;s pity. <br><br><br> 
The day you are able to see the lies within your favorite books from adolescence you become an adult. That&rsquo;s my rite of passage. It is not alcohol like many propose. For now, I&rsquo;ll stick to crying "Oh no Jose Modesto Buenrostro, don&rsquo;t leave me for la otra," whenever I feel I must moisturize my eyeball. <br><br><br>
At exactly 3:05 P.M. every Thursday notebook in hand, I enter the local pub to have a few drinks before happy hour ends and prices inflate to seven dollars a Corona. My favorite bartender is on shift those days. From what I have gathered, the real name of this character is not Alice Bratta but Alex Mata. I usually sit at the counter and order a full glass of Johnny with a splash of Fireball. The bartender is not very friendly and doesn&rsquo;t speak much. I like that.
<br><br><br>
I am in bed and I have to be still stiller than a victim of taxidermy. There is only the sound of my heart pumping. Streams of thoughts become a rope that extends and becomes smaller with each pump. The rope struggles with physicality. It gets bigger and smaller, and then it is just a flicker. This is my lifeline, and if I ever lose sight of it, I might have to stop.  If I am stiller than ever, I can regulate my breathing to follow the solo riffs of an electric guitar. I am able to fill the elevation of my body slowly peeling away from the mattress. The space between feels like ocean waves, and I float swaying slightly. I exist outside of time for a brief moment. <br><br><br>
It doesn&rsquo;t last much because before long doubt lurks underneath like a boa constrictor under my bed. It reaches my feet and curls around them carefully and slowly makes its way up until I can&rsquo;t breathe. Terror paralysis me. My breaths become irregular, and my heart races uncontrollably. I say my goodbyes yelling the lyrics of a black metal song,<br><br>
"Burning naked but smiling<br>
Not full of fear but pride<br>
Knowing death alone could cleanse them<br>
Of the reasons for which they all died...<br>
For all those who died." <br>
I fight it off until morning when the boa constrictor slithers away at first sunburst. Sometimes it lays an egg, which I must fertilize and incubate. Nothing has hatched yet because I am human, and I grow cempazuchilts for a living. I have no time for tricks.
<br><br><br>
Not still, but silent.
